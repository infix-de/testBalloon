=== Evolution

This document outlines the TestBalloon plans to evolve in terms of API stability and features.

==== Current Status

TestBalloon is ready for use in production. Of course, you are advised to always determine the product's fit with your use cases first.

While TestBalloon's core structure is stable, some aspects of its public API may still change. So expect some migration issues.

==== Next Steps

* Provide complete documentation, showing common use cases for the entire API.
* Determine common use cases and evolve the `TestConfig` builder to support them.
* Extract the compiler/Gradle plugin combination into a separate project with its own versioning.
* Extract existing extensions into separate projects with their own versioning.
* Create additional extensions for common use cases.

==== Stabilization (Release 1.0 and beyond)

===== Compatibility

TestBalloon aims to be

* *functionally stable* â€“ not changing behavior in incompatible or unexpected ways,
* *source compatible* as far as reasonable, providing a migration path for necessary changes,
* *binary compatible*, providing a stable binary API for extensions.

For further details, see https://youtu.be/cCgXtpVPO-o[Leonid Startsev's talk on API evolution from KotlinConf 2023].

===== Deprecation Cycles

Starting with release 1.0, TestBalloon's API evolution will include deprecation cycles for changes.

This means that an API change will

* start with a deprecation `WARNING` for the old API in version `n`,
* follow up with a deprecation `ERROR` in version `n+1`,
* finalize with a removal in version `n+2`.

For changes with source-compatible overloads, the old API will immediately receive a `HIDDEN` deprecation.

==== Practices

* Enable `abiValidation`, use `checkLegacyAbi`.
* Enable `explicitApi`.
* Enable `-Werror` or `warningsAsErrors`.
+
NOTE: This is currently not possible. See WORKAROUND comments in build-logic.
* Use `@TestBalloonInternalApi` for internal functions with technically public visibility.
* Propagate the experimental status of an upstream API (like `@ExperimentalCoroutinesApi`), if that API is not a TestBalloon-internal implementation detail.
* Introduce new experimental functionality with `@ExperimentalTestBalloonApi` (or a more specific annotation where applicable).
