> Testing: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the TestBalloon framework. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds; to seek out new bugs and new integrations; to boldly go where no one has gone before!

If you’d like to know why and how TestBalloon came to life, here is some [background].

You are wondering why TestBalloon works the way it does? Read about its [design considerations].

Finally, there is a brief [introduction to development].

For the curious:

* Read what needs to be considered when [integrating with Kotlin-related build tooling and the IDE](https://github.com/infix-de/testBalloon/blob/main/documentation/Kotlin_IDE_and_Build_Tool_Interoperability.adoc).
* Some [details about Android platform support](https://github.com/infix-de/testBalloon/blob/main/documentation/Android_Platform_Support.adoc).
